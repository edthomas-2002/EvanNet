Note: this version is currently set to multi-class classification. This does not yet work as desired. 
For binary classification, change the structure of your neural network (at the bottom when you intialize it) as well as the activation functions and their derivatives accordingly. Also need to change the contents of 'data.csv' by editing data-gen.py -- make it binary classes, don't convert to one-hot.
